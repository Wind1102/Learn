 âœ… Must-Learn for DevOps (Core Skills)

These are essential and youâ€™ll use them daily:

Chapter 1 â€“ Basics of Linux

1.1 Levels and Layers of Abstraction (overview)

1.3 The Kernel (just skim process/memory/system calls â€” enough to understand top/htop/ps outputs)

1.4 User Space

Chapter 2 â€“ Basic Commands & Filesystem

2.2 Using the Shell

2.3 Basic Commands (ls, cp, mv, rm, echo)

2.4 Navigating Directories

2.5 Intermediate Commands (grep, less, pwd, find, head/tail, sort)

2.14 Shell I/O (>, >>, 2>, pipes)

2.16 Listing & Killing Processes

2.17 File Modes & Permissions

2.18 Archiving & Compressing (tar, gzip)

2.19 Linux Directory Hierarchy Essentials

2.20 Running Commands as Superuser (sudo)

Chapter 4 â€“ Disks & Filesystems

4.2 Filesystems (types, mounting, /etc/fstab)

4.2.10 Filesystem Capacity (df, du)

4.2.11 Checking & Repairing Filesystems

Chapter 5 & 6 â€“ Booting & Init

Just learn systemd basics (services, units, logs, systemctl, journalctl)

Chapter 7 â€“ System Configuration

7.2 Logging

7.3 User & Group Management (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow)

7.6 cron (scheduling tasks)

7.10 PAM (just conceptually, for auth configs)

Chapter 8 â€“ Processes & Resource Monitoring

8.1 Tracking Processes (ps, top, htop)

8.2 lsof

8.3 strace (basic troubleshooting)

8.7 Resource Monitoring (CPU, memory)

8.10 vmstat, 8.11 iostat, 8.12 pidstat

Chapter 9 & 10 â€“ Networking

9.1â€“9.5 Basics: IP, subnet, routes, ping, traceroute, DNS

9.11 NetworkManager basics (if using on servers)

9.21 Firewalls (iptables, nftables, ufw)

10.3 SSH (client + server)

10.5 Diagnostic Tools (tcpdump, netcat, lsof)

Chapter 11 â€“ Shell Scripting

Conditionals, loops, variables, quoting

Using awk, sed, xargs
ðŸ‘‰ This is huge for automation (a DevOps must).

Chapter 12 â€“ Moving Files Across Network

rsync, scp basics

Samba/NFS just for awareness

Chapter 13 â€“ User Environments

Shell startup files (.bashrc, .profile)

Aliases, PATH, environment variables

Chapter 15â€“16 â€“ Development & Compilation

Only skim: understand compiling basics, but in DevOps youâ€™ll mostly use package managers & containers

Chapter 17 â€“ Advanced Topics

Skim cloud/virtualization/container mentions

ðŸš€ Suggested Learning Order for DevOps

Command-line basics & filesystem (Ch. 2)

Permissions & processes (Ch. 2.17 + Ch. 8)

Systemd & services (Ch. 6)

Users, groups, cron jobs (Ch. 7)

Networking + SSH (Ch. 9 & 10)

Shell scripting (Ch. 11)

File transfers & automation tools (Ch. 12, rsync, scp)

Logs & monitoring tools (Ch. 7.2 + Ch. 8)

Optional deeper dive: Kernel, compilation, virtualization

ðŸ‘‰ In practice, you donâ€™t need to read every section. Focus on server management, automation, monitoring, and networking â€” thatâ€™s the heart of DevOps Linux usage.
